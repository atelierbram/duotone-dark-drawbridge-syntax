# DuoTone dark Drawbridge

This theme is based on [Duotone Themes](http://simurai.com/projects/2016/01/01/duotone-themes/) by [Simurai](http://simurai.com/) for Atom.

> “DuoTone themes use only 2 hues (7 shades in total). It __tones down__ less important parts (like punctuation and brackets) and highlights only the __important__ ones. This leads to a more calm color scheme, but still lets you find the stuff you're looking for.”

Theme colors are warm blue and turquoise, see a [preview here on Base2Tone](http://base2t.one/demo/drawbridge/)

## Language support

DuoTone themes are optimized for many languages:

> C, Clojure, CoffeeScript, C#, CSS, GF Markdown, Go, Haskell, HTML, Java, JavaScript, JSON, Less, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, SASS, SCSS, Stylus, XML, YAML...

More optimizations to come. See the growing list of [all languages](/styles/languages).
